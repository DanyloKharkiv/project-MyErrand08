## MyErrand Frontend

MyErrand is an advanced task management web application built using the latest technologies. Our frontend is developed using React and various other libraries, working in harmony to provide an exceptional user experience.

The application enables authorized users to create and manage tasks efficiently. Users can categorize tasks into boards and columns, update them as necessary, and even remove them. Additionally, it offers the option to select a custom background for the board and filter tasks based on user preferences.

Tasks are represented as cards and can be seamlessly moved from one column to another, reflecting their progress. In case users encounter any difficulties, they can easily reach out to our support team through the provided form.
